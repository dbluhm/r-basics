when you say its just a joke or its locker room talk, you are also implicitly saying that its acceptable, normal, and even funny to talk about and treat women like objects.
if its not all men, its still *some* men and any at all is too many

**note: sexual violence happens to people of all genders. in this particular post, i am referring to the experiences that most women have with rape culture.

problems with the myth that a hymen  = virginity (or lack thereof):
this ""indicator"" of virginity is only relevant to vagina-owners, and therefore reinforces the cisheteronormative double standard that women who have sex are ""sluts"" while men who have sex are ""studs"" 
hymens can be stretched through activities/experiences other than sex, such as horseback riding, gymnastics, or even simply inserting a tampon during one's period
as of now, there is no known function for the hymen (some medical professionals suspect it may be for keeping bacteria and other hazards out of the vagina but no one knows for sure)
the idea that a hymen ""breaks"" the first time someone has vaginal sex can reinforce that it's ""normal"" for sex to be painful
while this *can* be the case, sex should generally* not be painful; if you are experiencing pain, talk to a trusted medical professional to see if it covers your entire vaginal canal

one misconception surrounding hpv (human papilloma virus) vaccines for teensparticularly within many religious communitiesis that it condones sexual activity during adolescence 
however, according to the @mayoclinic , research has [suggested] that receiving the vaccine at a young age isn't [generally associated with] an earlier start of sexual activity
also, as hard as it is to think about, you dont know whether your child will have sex forced on them through sexual assault; the last thing a sa victim needs on top of this trauma is worrying about the risk of hpv
even if your child is *not* victimized, its likely that they will one day become sexually active
also, even if your child is committed to only having sex within marriage, there is (unfortunately) the chance that their spouse will be unfaithful and end up exposing them to hpv as a result; again, the last thing they would need on top of dealing with infidelity would be worrying about potential hpv exposure
the vaccine is also is generally more effective in fighting this sti when administered at younger ages rather than in adulthood and *prior* to any exposure to hpv
hpv vaccines have also been associated with the prevention of various types of cancer
some other things to note about the hpv vaccine:
does not replace the need for a pap smear
not recommended if you are pregnant or are moderately to severely ill
may not be suitable for people with allergies to yeast or latex

additional thoughts: this is not to say that the purpose comprehensive sex ed is to teach minors that they should walk out of sex ed and immediately go engage in the behaviors discussed in class
rather, the idea is that kids and teens should a) receive accurate and age-appropriate sex ed at every age (even just using the correct terminology for body parts and teaching consent) so that b) they can make informed choices when/if the time comes that they *do* engage in sexual behaviors
finally, even if you expect your teen to be abstinent* until marriage, two things (at least) are critical for this to happen: 
1 they need the tools to navigate consent conversations, which is an integral part of comprehensive sex ed
2 *your kid* needs to be committed to this and understand why it's important; in the end, they have autonomy

did you know? according to the njk version of the bible*, it only states that *david* was on the roof; it does not state that bathsheba was bathing on the roof  contrary to what that leonard cohen (hallelujah) song implies: 
2 samuel 11: 2-3: and it came to pass in an eveningtide, that david arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the kings house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
and david sent and inquired after the woman. and one said, is not this bath-sheba, the daughter of eliam, the wife of uriah the hittite?
while its true that these verses dont specify where exactly bathsheba was bathing herself, the verses do tell us that david creepily checking bathsheba out from his roof
not only that, david also sent for bathsheba (a summons i suspect she couldnt refuse, he being the king) and sexually assaulted her
while it *could* be true that bathsheba was bathing on the roof of her house, we (to my knowledge) have no evidence of anything other than david lusting after and raping her
in other words, bathsheba was *not* asking for it regardless of where she was bathing  no one asks for it. ever. 
also, seeing as consent is to be freely-given, i suspect that bathsheba was *not* likely to have been in a position to say no (particularly since david obviously controlled where her husband was placed in battle)
so, instead of (potentially) viewing bathsheba as possibly contributing to what happened to her, lets more explicitly acknowledge that a) it was most likely *david* who went out of his way to make poor choices and abused his power as king and b) bathsheba is most likely a victim-survivor of sexual assault who did nothing to""ask for it.""

lets talk dialectics for a second: it can be true that not all men harass, assault, undermine, or otherwise abuse women and be true that many, many women are abused and/or consistently calculate the odds of being abused within a given situation
in other words, the fact that not all men treat women this way does not negate the constant vigilance that many women must maintain
ironically, the very act of saying not all men is a form of harassment, as it implies that discussing violence against women is an invalid argument since not every man abuses women
however, saying not all men is typically more often exacerbates the situation, rather than improves it
so, men, please use the power that we dont have to help enact change among your peers: call out rape jokes, sexual harassment, speak up when you see a buddy repeatedly buying drinks for someone

**note: this post focuses on male violence towards women. however, this does not mean that men cant be victimized; male victimization is *very* common (see @1in6org for more details)
also, when discussing violence against women, the focus is generally on white cis women rather than also including bipoc women of various racialized minority groups, and trans women. we can and must expand the conversation to include these groups

couple of thoughts:
1 this does not mean that men cant or arent raped; some research suggests that 1 in 6 men in the u.s. have experienced sexual assault (check out @1in6org for more info)
2 contrary to the implications of rape myths, many women are consistently calculating the risk of engaging in certain activities with certain people (e.g., attending a party alone, walking home at night, etc.); not plotting ways to lead men on

"**tw: rape**
when we subscribe to the belief that rape is a crime of passion, that it only happens to young attractive women, or that people ask for it, we perpetuate generations of rape myths
as has been said in a post thats been going around, when people say that they raped someone at something (e.g., video games, ping pong, whatever), that is a violent allusion to having power over another person; not that they were so attracted to that person that they couldnt help themselves
likewise, when we are talking about aggravated assault and/or physical assault we dont generally say things like well how do we know they didnt want to get punched? or how do we know they didnt want a weapon pulled on them?
victim-blaming statements should sound just as ridiculous as statements like the ones above
the rape myths and rape culture has to stop with us; when we continue saying things like boys will be boys and well why was she out that late and this is going to ruin his life, we will continue to live in a society that perpetuates rape culture
its not enough to give out rape whistles or install more lights in parking lotswe must proactively teach everyone that everyone deserves respect and that sex should always be consensual and mutually fulfilling; not a means of overpowering another person

"some other reasons porn isnt realistic:
it typically starts mid sexual encounter and therefore doesnt show pre-sex communication, like asking for consent 
it generally doesnt show on-going sexual consent communication during the encounter 
it is often penetration-focused
it commonly features actors with artificially augmented bodies
also, here are some reasons porn can be harmful:
it often fetishizes people of different racialized identities
as seen above, it can create unrealistic expectations for sex
it can normalize sexual violence
some actors in porn videos may not be engaging in porn voluntarily 
it can lead to objectification 
it can be especially harmful when used by teens, as some researchers believe that their brains cant process pornagraphic material like adult brains do
likewise, it often gives teens a unrealistic perception of sex (e.g., that violence is normal)
all of that said, i want to emphasize that just because porn may be harmful and unrealistic does not mean that people dont use it
porn usage is extremely common and first exposure is generally unintentional and around age 11
involuntary exposure to porn can happen, even when participating in something as a innocuous as a zoom meeting (i.e., if the meeting is zoom bombed)
porn also often serves as a form of sex ed for many teens, as they often dont get information about sex from other places
finally, just because someone uses or has used porn does not mean they have an addiction or are a horrible person; sometimes porn usage is a result of trying to deal with stress, loneliness, etc.
^this may seem obvious or ridiculous to some, but this information is often unknown to communities that have strong reactions to learning of porn usage (e.g., religious groups)

"it may be obvious, but it bears repeating imo: sexual violence statistics are not just made up of numbers; each statistic is made up of someone who was brave enough to share their story and who has had to do the incredibly difficult work of trying to heal from this trauma
so when you hear things like 1 in 3 women or 1 in 6 men, that means that likely 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men that you know have experienced sa

yes! abstinence-only sex ed can not in good conscience be called sex education if all it does is tell people not to have sex or warn them about stis
is abstinence a valid option? yes. should we warn youth about stis? absolutely
but only telling students what not to do will most likely not help them to avoid things like early sexual debut, risky sex, teen pregnancy, and stis because they wont have been educated on how to avoid those things
even if a young person is committed to waiting until marriage to have sex, comprehensive sex ed has merritt, especially since it a) teaches about things like boundaries, consent, and communication and b) they will have a lot of the knowledge they need to have a healthy sexual relationship once married
comprehensive sex ed is associated with lower rates of sexual violence

"want to interrupt sexual harassment, rape jokes, or any other inappropriate behavior but not sure how to go about it? youre not alone!
having been socialized to be polite, submissive, helpful, and not cause a scene, it can be really hard for me to feel like i can intervene
thankfully, there are many ways to interrupt* harassment when referring to the 5 ds of bystander intervention from @righttobeorg (formerly hollaback)
1 distract  this could look like changing the conversation topic, spilling your drink, asking the person being harassed for the time, etc.
2 delegate  this could look like asking a bartender for help, getting the attention of a store associate, etc.
3 document  this often looks like filming the harassment from a safe distance and then asking the person who was harassed what they would like done with it
also: if the person asks you to stop filming, stop immediately and delete the video
4 delay  this might look like going up to the person after the harassment happens and asking them if they are okay, offering to accompany them to their destination, etc.
5 (being) direct  this may look like directly telling the harasser to stop (or something like it)
this is the kind of approach that comes to mind for a lot of people when thinking about bystander intervention
however, as we can see, there is a host of ways to interrupt a problematic situation
choose one that feels most natural for you and practice what you might say or do in a situation that needs interrupting
which of the 5 ds have you used (or would you use)? comment below

^please credit @famousfemaleartist if you repost!
:@howtobehumanpod 
the @kinseyinstitute provides one more reason for comprehensive sex ed: the average age of people in the u.s. at first sex is 17*
in other words, even if first-year college students** receive formalized education on topics such as consent, birth control, anatomy, boundaries, etc. there is a good chance that they've already had sex
on top of this, not every teen/young adult will attend college; non-matriculated young adults will thus be left out if the expectation is that people learn about sex at college
even if a teen/young adult is committed to abstinence prior to marriage, the average age of first exposure to pornography is around age 11 and most teens have seen pornography well before they enter adulthood or get married; as dr. paul weigle from @hartford_healthcare has stated, ""porn has become the biggest source of sex education for a lot of young people.""***
so, what's the takeaway? talk to your kids about sex in positive, accurate, and age-appropriate ways. otherwise, they will likely receive their sex ""education"" from pornography, peers, and other sources that don't have their safety and best interest at heart
